# Ban System Flow Diagram

## Before (Problem)

```
Application Startup
    │
    ├─► Load bans.csv
    │   └─► Store in memory: [Ban1, Ban2, Ban3]
    │
    └─► Application runs...
        │
        ├─► User enters game
        │   └─► Check memory: Is user banned?
        │       └─► Use CACHED list: [Ban1, Ban2, Ban3]
        │
        ├─► Admin removes Ban2 from bans.csv
        │   └─► ⚠️ NO EFFECT - memory not updated
        │
        └─► User enters game (should be allowed)
            └─► Check memory: Is user banned?
                └─► ❌ STILL using OLD list: [Ban1, Ban2, Ban3]
                    └─► User STILL BANNED (BUG!)
```

## After (Solution)

```
Application Startup
    │
    ├─► Load bans.csv
    │   ├─► Store in memory: [Ban1, Ban2, Ban3]
    │   └─► Remember file modification time: T1
    │
    └─► Application runs...
        │
        ├─► User enters game
        │   ├─► Check if CSV modified? (compare file time vs T1)
        │   │   └─► No changes detected
        │   └─► Check memory: Is user banned?
        │       └─► Use current list: [Ban1, Ban2, Ban3]
        │
        ├─► Admin removes Ban2 from bans.csv
        │   └─► File modification time changes to T2
        │
        └─► User enters game (should be allowed)
            ├─► Check if CSV modified? (compare file time vs T1)
            │   └─► ✅ CHANGE DETECTED (T2 > T1)
            │       ├─► 📝 Log: "Ban CSV file has been modified, reloading"
            │       ├─► Reload bans.csv
            │       ├─► Update memory: [Ban1, Ban3]
            │       └─► Update modification time: T2
            │
            └─► Check memory: Is user banned?
                └─► ✅ Use UPDATED list: [Ban1, Ban3]
                    └─► User NOT banned (FIXED!)
```

## Key Points

### Problem
- Ban list was loaded ONCE at startup
- Changes to CSV file were IGNORED
- Required bot restart to reflect changes

### Solution
- Check CSV file modification time before EACH ban lookup
- Auto-reload if file was modified
- Changes take effect IMMEDIATELY
- No restart needed

### Benefits
1. **Real-time updates**: Changes to bans.csv take effect on next ban check
2. **No downtime**: No need to restart the bot
3. **Better debugging**: Comprehensive logging shows when reloads happen
4. **Transparency**: Logs show exact ban count and modification times

## Example Log Sequence

### User Gets Unbanned
```
[T0] INFO: Loaded 15 bans from CSV file {banCount: 15, lastModified: "2025-10-14T10:00:00"}
[T1] INFO: User entered game, checking ban status {steamId3: "U:1:123456"}
[T1] INFO: User is banned {steamId3: "U:1:123456", reason: "Cheating"}
[T1] WARN: Banned user attempted to join server
[T1] INFO: Executing ban command via RCON
[T1] INFO: Successfully banned user

--- Admin removes U:1:123456 from bans.csv ---

[T2] INFO: User entered game, checking ban status {steamId3: "U:1:123456"}
[T2] INFO: Ban CSV file has been modified, reloading bans {previousModTime: "T0", newModTime: "T2"}
[T2] INFO: Loaded 14 bans from CSV file {banCount: 14, lastModified: "2025-10-14T10:05:00"}
[T2] DEBUG: User is not banned {steamId3: "U:1:123456", totalBansChecked: 14}
```

Notice:
- Ban count decreased from 15 to 14
- "Ban CSV file has been modified" message appears
- User is now checked against the NEW list (14 bans)
- User is no longer banned ✅
