# Ban System Auto-Reload Implementation

## Problem Statement

Users reported that after removing entries from the `bans.csv` file, players were still getting auto-banned on servers. The issue was that the ban list was only loaded once at application startup and never refreshed, requiring a full bot restart for changes to take effect.

## Solution Summary

Implemented automatic CSV file reload based on file modification time. The system now:
- Tracks the CSV file's modification timestamp
- Checks for changes before each ban lookup
- Automatically reloads the ban list when the file is modified
- Provides comprehensive logging for all ban-related operations

## Key Features

✅ **Auto-Reload**: Ban list automatically reloads when CSV is modified  
✅ **No Restart**: Changes take effect immediately without bot restart  
✅ **Comprehensive Logging**: Every ban decision and reload is logged  
✅ **Full Test Coverage**: Unit tests verify reload functionality  
✅ **Complete Documentation**: Troubleshooting guide and examples  

## How It Works

1. **Initial Load**: Bot loads bans.csv and tracks modification time (T1)
2. **Ban Check**: Before checking if user is banned, compare current file time
3. **Change Detected**: If file time > T1, reload the entire ban list
4. **Log & Update**: Log the reload and update the stored modification time
5. **Continue**: Proceed with ban check using the fresh data

## Testing

Run the validation script:
```bash
./scripts/test-ban-reload.sh
```

All validation checks pass ✅

## Example Usage

1. User is banned and tries to join
   - Log: `INFO: User is banned {steamId3: "U:1:123456", reason: "Cheating"}`
   
2. Admin removes user from bans.csv and saves

3. User tries to join again
   - Log: `INFO: Ban CSV file has been modified, reloading bans`
   - Log: `INFO: Loaded 14 bans from CSV file {banCount: 14, ...}`
   - Log: `DEBUG: User is not banned {steamId3: "U:1:123456", ...}`
   - User is allowed to join ✅

## Impact

**Before**: Removing someone from bans.csv had no effect until bot restart  
**After**: Removing someone from bans.csv takes effect immediately on next check

## Logs to Watch

When the system is working correctly, you'll see:
- `INFO: Loaded X bans from CSV file` - Initial load
- `INFO: Ban CSV file has been modified, reloading bans` - Auto-reload triggered
- `INFO: User is banned` or `DEBUG: User is not banned` - Ban check results

## Result

✅ **Issue Resolved**: If you remove someone from bans.csv, they will no longer get auto-banned on your servers!
