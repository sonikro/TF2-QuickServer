# Copilot Instructions for TF2 Server Configuration

## Overview

This project manages Team Fortress 2 server configurations through Docker images with different variants and configurations. All server configuration is handled through files in the `variants` directory, and map availability is controlled by the `maps.json` file in the repository root.

## Maps Management

- The `maps.json` file in the repository root defines all maps that should be available on the server
- Maps are downloaded via the `npm run download:maps` command, which reads `maps.json`
- Maps can be specified in two formats:
  - Simple string format: Just the map name (e.g., `"cp_process_f12"`) will download from serveme.tf fastDL
  - Object format: With `name` and `url` properties to specify a custom download URL

Example map entry in `maps.json`:
```json
[
    "cp_process_f12",
    {
        "name": "koth_berry_b3a",
        "url": "https://tf2maps.net/downloads/borgville.19389/download"
    }
]
```

## Server Configuration Structure

- All addons, configuration files, and plugins are stored in the `variants/base/tf` folder
- Files in this folder are automatically copied to all Docker images during build
- Configuration files (`.cfg`) are located in `variants/base/tf/cfg`
- SourceMod plugins (`.smx`) are stored in `variants/base/tf/addons/sourcemod/plugins`

## Docker Images

This repository generates three different Docker images:

1. **sonikro/fat-tf2-standard-competitive:latest**
   - Same as standard-competitive but includes all maps specified in `maps.json`
   - This is the image deployed for the majority of servers

2. **sonikro/fat-tf2-standard-competitive-amd64:latest**
   - 64bit variant of the fat-standard-competitive image

3. **sonikro/fat-tf2-pickup:latest**
   - Specialized image used only for pickup game variants
   - Contains additional plugins specific to pickup games

## Enforced CVars

- The `variants/base/enforced_cvars.cfg` file contains server CVars that should be applied to all configurations
- This file is processed by the container's custom entrypoint script
- These values will override any conflicting values in other CFG files on the server
- Use this file with caution, as it affects all server variants

Example of enforced CVars:
```
tv_snapshotrate 33
tv_maxrate 30000
mp_idlemaxtime 45
```

### Base Image for TF2 Servers

The base image is ghcr.io/melkortf/tf2-competitive and the Dockerfile for that image is available at https://github.com/melkortf/tf2-servers/blob/master/packages/tf2-competitive/Dockerfile. Use this when trying to understand the underlying structure and configuration of the TF2 server images.
