> Instantly deploy **Team Fortress 2** servers straight from Discord — powered by Docker, Oracle Cloud, and SDR.

---

## 🚀 Overview

**TF2-QuickServer** is a Discord bot that lets you spawn TF2 servers instantly in multiple regions using Oracle Container Instances. Whether you're playing competitive or just want to chill with friends, it's never been easier to get a server up and running in a few minutes.

---

## ✨ Features

- ✅ **One-Click Server Deployment** – Launch a TF2 server via simple Discord commands  
- 🌍 **Multi-Region Support** – Deploy in various **Oracle Cloud regions** for minimal latency  
- 🔐 **DDoS Protection** – All servers use **Steam Datagram Relay (SDR)** for secure connections  
- 🛆 **Containerized Architecture** – Fully isolated Docker containers per server  
- ⏱️ **Cost-Efficient** – Idle servers automatically shut down after 10 minutes

---

## 🧐 How It Works

1. **Join our Discord Channel**
2. **Run a Command** – Example: `/create-server sa-saopaulo-1`
3. **Select a Variant** – Use the buttons shown in Discord to pick your server type (e.g., `standard-competitive`).
4. **Receive Server Info** – Get detailed connection info for your server, including SDR, direct, and TV connect addresses.
5. **Play!** – Join with friends and frag away!

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- 🛠️ **Terraform** – Provisions all necessary Oracle Cloud infrastructure  
- 🧪 **OCI-SDK (Node.js)** – Dynamically creates container instances  
- 📂 **SQLite** – Fast, local database to track server and user state  
- 🐳 **Docker** – All servers are built from containerized images

## 📘 Commands

| Command | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `/create-server <region>` | Launches a server in the selected region (you'll be prompted to select a variant) |
| `/terminate-servers` | Terminates all servers created by the user |
| `/get-balance` | Shows your available credits (Only enabled if credits are enabled) |
| `/buy-credits` | *(Coming soon!)* Purchase credits |
| `/set-user-data <steamId>` | Sets the SteamID of the user, assigning them as the Sourcemod admin for all servers the user creates |

> 💡 *Empty servers are terminated after 10 minutes of inactivity.*

## 🌎 Supported Regions

Any region that supports **Oracle Container Instances** is fair game.  
See the full list: [Oracle Cloud Regions](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/public-cloud-regions/)

## 🔧 Self-Hosting

Want to run your own version? Follow the steps below:

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sonikro/TF2-QuickServer.git
cd TF2-QuickServer
```

### 2️⃣ Configure Environment

Create a `.env` file:

```env
# Discord Bot
DISCORD_TOKEN=
DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=

# Oracle Cloud Auth
OCI_CONFIG_FILE=

# Third-party Services
DEMOS_TF_APIKEY=
LOGS_TF_APIKEY=
```

### 3️⃣ Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

## 🗺️ Maps Setup (Fat Images)

Oracle Container Instances do **not** support NFS or shared file systems like FSS. Instead, this project uses Docker **fat images** that bake in all TF2 maps directly.

### Download maps:

```bash
npm run download:maps
```

This will create the `maps/` folder and download all maps listed in `maps.json`.

> 📝 Maps are gitignored and stored in a local `maps` folder.  
> The [mapdownloader plugin](https://github.com/spiretf/mapdownloader) is also included and will attempt to fetch missing maps dynamically if needed.

---

## ☁️ Deploy Oracle Infrastructure

Make sure you're authenticated with OCI. Then run:

```bash
npm run oracle:deploy
```

> This command runs Terraform to create required infra and generates a `config/local.json` file with all outputs.  
> TF2-QuickServer code reads this file at runtime to determine which OCI resources to use.

## 🧪 Run the Bot

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Running with Docker Compose

```yaml
services:
  tf2-quickserver:
    image: sonikro/tf2-quickserver:latest
    restart: always
    ports:
      - 8000:3000
    env_file:
      - .env
    volumes:
      - ./db:/app/db
      - ./config:/app/config:ro
      - ./keys:/app/keys:ro
```

> Make sure you have your config files in the ./config directory
